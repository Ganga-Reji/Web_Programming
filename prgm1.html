        <b><i>The modern Olympic Games or Olympics</i></b>are the leading international sporting events featuring 
        summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes 
        from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. 
        The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition 
        with more than 200 teams,The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented; colonies and overseas territories are allowed to field their own teams. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and terrorism. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and 
        country to showcase themselves to the world. <u><br><br>The Olympic Games are held every 4 consecutive years</u>
        Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games
         held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. 
         Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded<u>the International Olympic Committee (IOC)</u> in 1894,
        leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.
        The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics combined, in 35 different sports and over 400 events.[4][5] The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: 
        gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.
